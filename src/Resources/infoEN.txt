<html><pre><strong>Dr David R Hawkins Levels of Consciousness</strong></pre><br>According to Hawkins we, as humans, live at vastly different "levels" of consciousness. All these levels, along with the "truth level" of ANY true/false style inquiry,<br> can be tested for truth and numerically "calibrated" through muscle testing, on a logarithmic scale of 1-1000. <br>According to Hawkins, any person, concept, thought or object that calibrates at 200 (The level of Integrity) or above is positive ("power"); anything below 200 is negative ("force").<br><a href>http://www.spiritualteachers.org/david-hawkins/</a><br>How To Raise Your Level Of Consciousness Through Meditation<br><a href>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vydsuhnqSY</a><br>or with the help of other methods, for example, the method of Sedona or <br>Spiritual Integration of the famous Russian psychologist Konstantin Dowlatov.
